# Mantine [Catalog](https://mantine-catalog.com)

*üóÉÔ∏è A huge catalog of React components, templates and themes using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) to build beautiful UIs*

</div>

## About this catalog

This catalog is an extension of [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev), offering several new components, as well as templates and color themes.

Mantine gives us a well-established base (colors, spacing, typography, components,...). This catalog brings all of this together, offering
you inspiration during the development of your front-end. Use this catalog to build your front-end **_faster_** and **_easier_**!

## Installation

You don't need to install anything other than Mantine. Just copy and paste the source code and you're ready to go!

> [!NOTE]
> We use [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons) icons ([the recommended](https://mantine.dev/guides/icons) icon library for Mantine) in components
> and templates, but you can swap it with any other icon library of your preference

## Features

## FAQ

### 1. Why Mantine?

With Mantine we will hardly have to create any components or hooks from scratch, or even customize anything. For most interfaces, it offers all
the necessary features, as well as being extremely well made and easy to use

### 2. Why not contribute directly to Mantine UI?

Although [Mantine UI](https://github.com/mantinedev/ui.mantine.dev) is open source, contributions are not directly open to the community.
For this reason, I decided to create this repository
